          # deploy to public_html or subfolder depending on your structure
          # if the user followed the guide to put project outside public_html, adjust accordingly.
          # For now, assuming standard verified structure deploy to root or public_html
          # Based on previous context, user might be putting everything in public_html/
          # but a safer bet is just syncing content.
          # Let's assume standard deployment to root of FTP user home or specific folder.
          # If the user has a specific 'public_html' folder in their repo, we map it.
          # But Laravel works differently.
          # We deploy the WHOLE project.
